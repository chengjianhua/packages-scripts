## The problem

I do a bunch of open source and want to make it easier to maintain so many
projects.

## This solution

This is a CLI that abstracts away all configuration for my open source projects
for linting, testing, building, and more.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```
npm install --save-dev packages-scripts
```

## Usage

This is a CLI and exposes a bin called `packages-scripts`.

## Motivation

## Inspiration

This is a fork from [kcd-scripts](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts) which is created by brilliant Kent!

I have some my own specific needs and some ideas are waiting for me to achieve them, so I copy it and am ready to do some jobs.

I hope to make a cli application to help me bundle packages with common package or packages inside a "monorepo". If it's done, it'll free me so much.

Currently lacking documentation.

## Other Solutions

If you know some tools that aim to complete similar targets like this and you are please [make a pull request][prs] and add it
here! Again, it's very kind of you.
